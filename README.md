# File Copy Module

This module provides functions to copy various types of files, including audio, video, photos, compressed files, and programming files. It uses multiple threads to perform the copying process in parallel, resulting in faster execution.

## Getting Started

To use the module, simply import the necessary functions and call the `copy` function with the desired path. The `copy` function creates multiple threads for each type of file and starts copying. It then waits for all threads to finish and prints a message indicating the success of the operation.

## How to use

replace `____your path____` with the path of the directory you want to copy
